The project's intention was to learn the awesome functionalities of the [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) and is based on a beautiful CSS experiment by [CoDrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/23/fullscreen-layout-with-page-transitions/). 

The full-screen layout features some advanced CSS technics like page animations and transitions. Unfortunately the layout is not fully responsive and works only with modern browsers.
