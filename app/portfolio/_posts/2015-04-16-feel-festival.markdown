The Feel Festival is a small yet popular festival at Bergheider See near Berlin, Germany. The 3 year young festival formerly situated at Kiekebusch See attracts house afficionados as well as indie youngsters. 

The festival's success lies probably in the effort to create an experience you can... feel (sorry for that wordplay). The decoration is pretty awesome, the atmosphere is cosy, almost familiar and the bookers are always looking for young talents and friends instead of stars. It feels handmade and crafted by heart.

After setting the tone and direction of their brand identity already in 2013, it was time to revamp their website this year.
