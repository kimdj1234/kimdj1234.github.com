Four generations of experience in selling cheese set the base for a wonderful new family-owned start-up.

[BRIE ET SES AMIS](https://brie-et-amis.com/) delivers the lively cheese tradition of France to your home. You can order subscriptions with hand-picked pieces or buy delicious brie a la carte. The French-German family business will supply you with freshly delivered goods on a regular basis.

The project's challenge was to design and build a multilingual eCommerce solution with a subscriptions module and different payment gateways based on WordPress and WooCommerce.
